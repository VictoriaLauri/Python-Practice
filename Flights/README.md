## Task description:

The purpose of this exercise was to initialize a class and practice class methods, loops and conditional statements.
Suppose, we want to add passenger names to a flight, but we do not want to overbook the flight.
We create a Flight class and equip it with methods of defining its capacity, seat availability and a way to add passenger names to the list. The user is prompted to input the name of the passenger and receives a confirmation that the passenger name has been added to the flight. Once the capacity is reached, the user is notified that there are no more seats available on this flight.
